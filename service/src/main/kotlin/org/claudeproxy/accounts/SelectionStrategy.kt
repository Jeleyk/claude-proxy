/**
 * How [AccountPool] orders the candidates inside one tier.
 *
 * [PRIORITY] is the historical behaviour and stays the default: drain `(priority, id)` order
 * until each account crosses its threshold. It is the right shape for the 5-hour window, which
 * is a rate limit — long dwell on one account keeps prompt-cache locality, and the accounts
 * behind it hold their windows in reserve.
 *
 * It is the wrong shape for the **weekly** window, which is a fixed 7-day quota anchored per
 * account: unused quota is forfeited at the reset, the resets are staggered, and a static
 * `priority` cannot track a moving deadline. The account with the highest `priority` number
 * therefore writes off quota every seven days — measured at 52% of one Max window on
 * 2026-09-22.
 *
 * [DEADLINE] fixes the order without touching the sequentiality: earliest weekly reset first, so
 * perishable quota is spent before it expires. Ties inside a [BUCKET_HOURS]-hour horizon are
 * broken by 5-hour headroom, which picks the account that can run longest before rotating — the
 * same choice that minimises rotations, and therefore cache re-writes. Spreading load across
 * accounts would fix neither: there is no account affinity (`SessionMapRepo` rotates session ids
 * rather than pinning them), so a spread multiplies cache-prefix re-writes, and those are paid
 * in the same weekly window this is trying to stop wasting.
